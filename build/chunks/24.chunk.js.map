using a fast, naive layout algorithm that stacks images in order until the viewport has been filled.\n *    After measurement is complete (componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate) this component evaluates positioned cells\n *    in order to determine if another measurement pass is required (eg if actual cell sizes were less than estimated sizes).\n *    All measurements are permanently cached (keyed by `keyMapper`) for performance purposes.\n * 2) Second pass uses the external `cellPositioner` to layout cells.\n *    At this time the positioner has access to cached size measurements for all cells.\n *    The positions it returns are cached by Masonry for fast access later.\n *    Phase one is repeated if the user scrolls beyond the current layout's bounds.\n *    If the layout is invalidated due to eg a resize, cached positions can be cleared using `recomputeCellPositions()`.\n *\n * Animation constraints:\n *   Simple animations are supported (eg translate/slide into place on
